# Spectral-Clustering

Spectral clustering users based on their preferences

The goal of this project is to find groups of users with similar preferences using Spectral clustering. Given a fragment of the Yelp social network, represented by an undirected weighted graph. Nodes in the graph represent users. If two users are connected by an edge of weight 𝑤, it means that they have both left positive reviews to the same 𝑤 restaurants.

The project includes:
- Implementing spectral clustering
- Quantitatively evaluate the results
- Visualize the results
